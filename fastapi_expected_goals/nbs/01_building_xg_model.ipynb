    "# Building an Expected Goals Model\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the videos by [Prof. David Sumpter](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/28112/pages/2-statistical-models-of-actions), we will fit a *Logistic Regression* model to estimate xG. This model will have two input variables - distance of a shot from goal and angle of the shot to the width of the goal. To fit the model, we will use [event data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) from La Liga (Spanish league) matches provided by Statsbomb.\n",

    "- Technique whose values can be one of Backheel, Diving header, Half volley, Lob, Normal, Overhead kick, or volley.\n",
    "- Body part which indicates if the shot was taken with the head, left foot, right foot, or other body part. This variable combined with information about which foot a player prefers can be useful in predicting if a shot will turn into a goal.\n",

    "In his video [The Ultimate Guide to Expected Goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=310_eW0hUqQ), Prof. Sumpter asserts that given the right variables, models more complex than Logistic Regression might not provide much better performance. Thus, improvements to the model can focus on adding more variables first and evaluating if they contribute to the model fit before experimenting with other models."
